A functional matching game, The psychic generates a random letter for the computer at the start of each round.  
It is up to the user to guess the letter in 10 guesses or less.  
Should the users guess match the computers chosen letter a "win" event is triggered that scoreboard updates the number of wins.
Should the user run out of guesses before correctly guessing the computers letter a "loss" event is triggered and the scoreboard updates the number of losses.

The game is automatically resarted up either event.
